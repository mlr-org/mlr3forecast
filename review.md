# mlr3forecast — Package Review

A top-down review of the package, with particular attention to the
README and whether it represents the package’s functionality. Worked
through in small, discrete steps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. README coverage of functionality

Question: *Does `README.Rmd` display all of the important functionality
of the package?*

Method: compared the features showcased in `README.Rmd` against all
exported objects in `NAMESPACE` (learners, measures, pipeops,
resamplings, tasks, and helper functions).

### What the README covers well

- Classical forecaster workflow: `train` → `predict` →
  [`generate_newdata()`](https://mlr3forecast.mlr-org.com/reference/generate_newdata.md)
  / `predict_newdata()` /
  [`forecast()`](https://generics.r-lib.org/reference/forecast.html)
- ML forecasting:
  [`recursive_forecaster()`](https://mlr3forecast.mlr-org.com/reference/recursive_forecaster.md)
  and
  [`direct_forecaster()`](https://mlr3forecast.mlr-org.com/reference/direct_forecaster.md)
- Temporal resamplings `fcst.holdout` / `fcst.cv`
- Feature engineering via `po("fcst.lags")` +
  [`selector_fcst_lags()`](https://mlr3forecast.mlr-org.com/reference/selector_fcst_lags.md)
- Quantile prediction (classical), exogenous covariates, benchmarking,
  ensembling (`po("regravg")`), tuning (`auto_tuner`), and global
  forecasting

### Notable gaps (advertised or important, but missing / under-shown)

1.  **The package’s own forecasting measures are never actually used.**
    Every `$score()` call in the README uses `msr("regr.rmse")`. Yet the
    package ships **12** forecasting measures: MASE, RMSSE, Pinball,
    Winkler, Coverage, MSIS, **WAPE, MPE, ACF1, and a directional family
    (MDA / MDV / MDPV)**. The intro lists 6 of them, but no example ever
    scores with one. For a forecasting package, not showing MASE / RMSSE
    at least once is a real gap. The directional measures and WAPE / MPE
    are not even mentioned.

BB: tabelle der measures erstellen bzw verlinken. in den beispielen
sollte auch mal EIN komplexeres zeigen. wenigstens sagen dass die
übersich im R index ist? verlinken? und halt mal ein measure in der
README zeigen.

2.  **Dedicated target-transform pipeops are not mentioned.** The README
    only demonstrates manual `log` / `exp` via the generic
    `ppl("targettrafo")`. But the package exports
    **`PipeOpTargetTrafoBoxCox` (`fcst.targetboxcox`)** and
    **`PipeOpTargetTrafoDifference` (`fcst.targetdiff`)** — Box-Cox and
    differencing are core TS transforms and ship ready-made.

BB: einfach ein satz dass das existiert?

3.  **Data import / IO is entirely absent.** Two exported user-facing
    helpers are unmentioned:
    **[`read_tsf()`](https://mlr3forecast.mlr-org.com/reference/read_tsf.md)**
    (Monash `.tsf` archive format) and
    **[`download_zenodo_record()`](https://mlr3forecast.mlr-org.com/reference/download_zenodo_record.md)**.
    Also
    [`as_task_fcst()`](https://mlr3forecast.mlr-org.com/reference/as_task_fcst.md)
    has methods for `ts`, `zoo`, `timeSeries`, `tsibble` (`tbl_ts`), and
    `tsf` objects — only the data.frame / tsibble paths are shown.

BB: ich denke das müssen wir nicht zeigen? dass ist “ausserhalb” von
mlr3? \# im buch könnte man das mal zeigen? finde ich aktuell nicht
soooo wichtig.

4.  **The learner roster is heavily under-represented.** 34 classical
    learners are exported; the README names ~6. Missing categories worth
    a mention: baselines (`mean`, `random_walk` — matter for the
    benchmarking story), intermittent demand (`croston`), count data
    (`tscount`), neural (`nnetar`, `mlp`, `elm`), and the whole
    `smooth`-package family (`adam`, `ces`, `gum`, `ssarima`,
    `msarima`). No pointer to a full list.

BB: point to full list, mention that we have many / what

5.  **Probabilistic forecasting is shown but never evaluated.** Quantile
    prediction is demonstrated for `auto_arima`, and Pinball / Winkler /
    Coverage / MSIS are listed — but a quantile prediction is never
    scored with them, and it is unclear whether ML forecasters support
    quantiles.

BB: say how you can see whezjer a learner supports this. and use one
measure

6.  **[`as_tasks_fcst()`](https://mlr3forecast.mlr-org.com/reference/as_task_fcst.md)
    (plural, multi-task creation) is unmentioned** — relevant to the
    global / longitudinal story.

**Minor:** `partition()`, [`as.ts()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/ts.html),
[`selector_fcst_rolling()`](https://mlr3forecast.mlr-org.com/reference/selector_fcst_rolling.md),
and built-in tasks `lynx` / `livestock` / `usaccdeaths` are not
surfaced.

### Resolution of BB comments (step 3)

All BB-marked comments above were resolved by brief, compact edits to
`README.Rmd` (kept short for a README). Summary:

- **BB \#1 (measures):** Added “see `mlr_measures$keys("^fcst")` for the
  full list” to the at-a-glance measures bullet, and now show a real
  forecasting measure — the classical resampling example aggregates
  `msrs(c("regr.rmse", "fcst.mase"))`.
- **BB \#2 (target-trafo pipeops):** Added one sentence after the ML
  target transformation example noting `po("fcst.targetboxcox")` and
  `po("fcst.targetdiff")` exist.
- **BB \#3 (data IO):** Agreed it is out of scope for the README (more
  of a book topic). No README change.
- **BB \#4 (learner roster):** Reworded the at-a-glance
  classical-forecasters bullet to convey “over 30” learners across
  categories (baselines, ARIMA, neural, count) and point to
  `mlr_learners$keys("^fcst")`.
- **BB \#5 (probabilistic):** Added
  `lrn("fcst.auto_arima")$predict_types` to show how to check supported
  predict types, and score a quantile prediction with
  `msr("fcst.pinball")` on in-sample rows (known truth).
- **Task enumeration (BB at minor):** Added an at-a-glance bullet
  listing the built-in tasks (`airpassengers`, `electricity`,
  `livestock`, `lynx`, `usaccdeaths`) with
  `as.data.table(mlr_tasks)[task_type == "fcst"]`.

Note: `gap #6`
([`as_tasks_fcst()`](https://mlr3forecast.mlr-org.com/reference/as_task_fcst.md))
had no BB mark, so it was left unchanged. `README.Rmd` still needs to be
re-knitted to regenerate `README.md`.

BB: enumerate the tasks
