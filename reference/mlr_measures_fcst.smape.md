# Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error

Measure of the symmetric mean absolute percentage error of forecasts.
Unlike the ordinary percentage error, it is bounded between 0 and 200
and treats over- and under-forecasting more symmetrically.

## Details

\$\$ \mathrm{sMAPE} = \frac{100}{n} \sum\_{i=1}^n \frac{2\\\lvert y_i -
\hat y_i \rvert}{\lvert y_i \rvert + \lvert \hat y_i \rvert} \$\$
